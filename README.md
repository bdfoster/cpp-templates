# cpp-templates
Various C++ templates I've built, ready to use or modify for your project needs.

You can check out the documentation for this project by either looking at the header files of the classes you're interested in, or navigate your web browser to file:///path/to/project/docs/html/index.html. I'm just getting the hang of doxygen... bear with me.
